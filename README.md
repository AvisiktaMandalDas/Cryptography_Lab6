# Cryptography_Lab6
This lab focuses on the implementation of a basic Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem (ECC) using Python. The objective of the lab is to help students understand how elliptic curves can be used to build a public-key cryptosystem that provides encryption and decryption with strong security properties. In this experiment, a small toy elliptic curve over a finite prime field is used so that all operations can be easily computed and observed. The lab demonstrates key operations such as point addition, point doubling, scalar multiplication, generation of a private–public key pair, and the complete encryption–decryption process using the Elliptic Curve ElGamal technique. To keep the lab simple and easy to understand, the message is encoded as a small integer and then mapped onto the curve, which allows students to see how messages transform into points during encryption.

The Python program is written step-by-step, starting from modular arithmetic and point operations, and leading to the implementation of key generation, encryption, and decryption functions. Each part of the code is carefully commented so students can follow the logic behind each mathematical operation. The demonstration at the end of the script shows the workflow of ECC: selecting a private key, generating a public key, encrypting a sample message, and successfully recovering the message during decryption. Since the curve used is intentionally small and the message encoding is simplified, this lab is meant only for academic understanding and not for any real-world secure communication.
